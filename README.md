# Scamp

A framework for writing [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) bots. Scamp is in early development so use it at your own risk, pull requests welcome.

Scamp is designed to be simple, to get out of your way and to let you do what you want. It doesn't have any baggage, so no administration web interfaces, no built in commands. It's a blank slate for you to build on.

If you like or use Scamp I'd love to hear from you. Drop me at line at will at 37signals dot com and tell me how you are using it.

## Requirements

Ruby >= 1.9.2 (At least for the named captures)

## Installation

`gem install scamp` or put `gem 'scamp'` in your Gemfile.

## Usage and Examples

### The most simple example:

    require 'scamp'
    
    scamp = Scamp.new(:api_key => "YOUR API KEY", :subdomain => "yoursubdomain", :verbose => true)
    
    scamp.behaviour do
      # Simple matching based on regex or string:
      match "ping" do
        say "pong"
      end
    end
    
    # Connect and join some rooms
    scamp.connect!([293788, "Monitoring"])

### A more in-depth run through

Matchers are tested in order and all that satisfy the match and conditions will be run. Careful, Scamp listens to itself, you could easily create an infinite loop. Look in the examples dir for more.

    require 'scamp'

    # Add :verbose => true to get debug output, otherwise the logger will output INFO
    scamp = Scamp.new(:api_key => "YOUR API KEY", :subdomain => "yoursubdomain", :verbose => true)
    
    scamp.behaviour do
      # 
      # Simple matching based on regex or string:
      # 
      match /^repeat (\w+), (\w+)$/ do
        say "You said #{matches[0]} and #{matches[1]}"
      end
      
      # 
      # A special user and room method is available in match blocks.
      # 
      match "a user said" do
        say "#{user} said something in room #{room}"
      end
      
      match "Hello!" do
        say "Hi there"
      end
      
      # 
      # You can play awesome sounds
      # 
      match "ohmy" do
        play "yeah"
      end
      
      # 
      # Limit the match to certain rooms, users or both.
      # 
      match /^Lets match (.+)$/, :conditions => {:room => "Some Room"} do
        say 'Only said if room name matches "Some Room"'
      end
      
      match "some text", :conditions => {:user => "Some User"} do
        say 'Only said if user name matches "Some User"'
      end
      
      match /some other text/, :conditions => {:user => "Some User", :room => 123456} do
        say "You can mix conditions"
      end

      match "some text", :conditions => {:room => ["Some Room", "Some Other Room"]} do
        say "You can list multiple rooms"
      end
      
      # 
      # Named captures become available in your match block
      # 
      match /^say (?<yousaid>.+)$/ do
        say "You said #{yousaid}"
      end
      
      # 
      # You can say multiple times, and you can specify an alternate room.
      # Default behaviour is to 'say' in the room that caused the match.
      # 
      match "something" do
        say "#{user} said something in room #{room}"
        say "#{user} said something in room #{room}", 237872
        say "#{user} said something in room #{room}", "System Administration"
      end
      
      # 
      # A list of commands is available as command_list this matcher uses it
      # to format a help text
      # 
      match "help" do
        max_command_length = command_list.map{|cl| cl.first.to_s }.max_by(&:size).size
        format_string = "%#{max_command_length + 1}s"
        formatted_commands = command_list.map{|action, conds| "#{sprintf(format_string, action)} | #{conds.size == 0 ? '' : conds.inspect}"}
        say <<-EOS
    #{sprintf("%-#{max_command_length + 1}s", "Command match")} | Conditions
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #{formatted_commands.join("\n")}
        EOS
      end
    end
      
    # Connect and join some rooms
    scamp.connect!([293788, "Monitoring"])

In the room/user conditions and say/play commands you can use the name or ID of a user or room, eg:

    :conditions => {:room => "some string"}
    :conditions => {:room => 123456}

    :conditions => {:user => "some string"}
    :conditions => {:user => 123456}

    say "#{user} said something in room #{room}", 237872
    say "#{user} said something in room #{room}", "System Administration"

By default Scamp listens to itself. This could either be fun, or dangerous, you decide. You can turn this off by passing :ignore\_self => true in the initialisation options:

    scamp = Scamp.new(:api_key => "YOUR API KEY", :subdomain => "yoursubdomain", :ignore_self => true)

Scamp will also run _all_ match blocks that an input string matches, you can make Scamp only run the first block it matches by passing in :first\_match\_only => true:

    scamp = Scamp.new(:api_key => "YOUR API KEY", :subdomain => "yoursubdomain", :first_match_only => true)

Scamp will listen to all messages that are sent on the rooms it is listening on and doesn't need to be addressed by name. If you prefer to only trigger bot commands when you address your bot directly add the :required\_prefix initialisation option:

    scamp = Scamp.new(:api_key => "YOUR API KEY", :subdomain => "yoursubdomain", :required_prefix => 'Bot: ')

Scamp will now require commands to begin with 'Bot: ' (or whatever you have specified), and will strip out this prefix before handing the message onto your match block.

## TODO

* Allow multiple values for conditions, eg: :conditions => {:user => ["Some User", "Some Other User"]}
* Add paste support

## How to contribute

Here's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:

1. Fork the project
2. Clone down your fork
3. Create a feature branch
4. Add your feature + tests
5. Make sure everything still passes by running the tests
6. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
7. Push the branch up
8. Send a pull request for your branch

Take a look at the TODO list or known issues for some inspiration if you need it.
